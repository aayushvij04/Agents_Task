    "emotion_reason": "Phrases like \"mai bohot bhuddu hun\" (I am very stupid) and \"fail ho jaunga\" (I will fail) express fear of failure.",
    "intent_reason": "Student's low confidence (0.4) overrides other intent signals; the fear and plea for help suggest a need for emotional support and encouragement, thus classified as chit-chat.",
    "topic_reason": "The mention of \"trigonometry\" clearly indicates the subject matter.",
